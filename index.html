        <p>Welcome to my website! This is a <em>amazing</em> website made for my <strong>class</strong>.
        if you want to support my website make sure you look around and look what I have made for this site. I really like counter strike 2.
        Lots of the sentencesa created here are going to be placeholders. 
        </p>
        <p> In order to hit the<strong> 4 paragraph requirement</strong> enjoy part of my <em>ECE 241 Lab report</em> from 2 weeks ago! At the start of the lab, the Arduino Nano is placed on the breadboard. Then, add wires to the breadboard. The Arduino program in the serial monitor can display 3 values. 
            We created the circuits on the breadboards utilizing resistors and wires and using the analog discovery to measure the ohms, amps, and voltage in the circuit and the appendix code so we could document our findings while changing the voltage to 0V,1.5V, 3V, and 4V. 
            We constructed 3 different measurements. Figure 6-4 measures voltage on the Nano, 6-5 measures Amps, and 6-6 measures Ohms of resistors. We used the analog discovery V+ to increase the Nano and the ground voltage.
            </p>
            <p>Wait thats not all! <b>I would like to thank the following people</b>: <em>My parents, my siblings, my frineds, my peers and classmates, and anyone who lieks dogs!</em> IF you are any of the people mentioned congrats you are awesome!

                <strong>One more thing</strong> I hope you are a fan of tic tac toe. As seen below there is a game of tic tac toe you can play. <em>This was created in class in CIS 115!</em>
            This make this website 30x better! Hope you enjoyed reading nothing!
